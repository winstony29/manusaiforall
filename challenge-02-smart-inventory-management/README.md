# Challenge 2: Smart Inventory Management for Zero-Waste Operations

**Problem Statement**

Bubble tea ingredients include perishable items like fresh fruit, milk, and tapioca pearls that have limited shelf life. How might we use AI to predict demand accurately and minimize food waste while ensuring popular items never run out?

**Background**

Running a bubble tea shop requires careful inventory management. Tapioca pearls must be prepared fresh daily, fruits have varying shelf lives, and demand can fluctuate based on weather, holidays, and local events. Over-ordering leads to waste and increased costs, while under-ordering results in disappointed customers and lost sales.

**Expected Outcomes**

Participants should develop an AI-powered inventory management system that predicts demand based on historical sales data, weather forecasts, local events, and seasonal trends. The solution should provide automated reorder suggestions, waste tracking, and alerts for items approaching expiration. Integration with supplier ordering systems would be a valuable addition.

**Success Metrics**

The solution should demonstrate measurable reduction in food waste, improved stock availability, and cost savings through optimized ordering.
