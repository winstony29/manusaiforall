**Design Movement:** Zen Garden Digital

**Core Principles:**
1. Serene, meditative layouts inspired by Japanese tea ceremony aesthetics
2. Generous whitespace that breathes like a traditional garden
3. Subtle organic curves and flowing transitions
4. Muted earth tones with strategic pops of tea-green accents

**Color Philosophy:** Soft cream backgrounds (#FDFBF7) with deep forest green (#1B4332) as primary, warm terracotta (#C4704F) as accent, and soft gold (#D4A574) for highlights. Evokes natural tea leaves and warmth.

**Layout Paradigm:** Vertical scroll with distinct "seasons" - each month flows like a scroll painting. Cards float with soft shadows. Asymmetric hero with overlapping elements.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Floating tea leaf decorations as subtle accents
2. Soft gradient overlays with paper texture
3. Rounded cards with gentle shadows

**Interaction Philosophy:** Smooth, unhurried transitions like pouring tea. Hover states reveal depth through subtle scale and shadow changes.

**Animation:** Gentle fade-up entrances, smooth scroll reveals, subtle parallax on decorative elements.

**Typography System:**

**Design Movement:** Warm Tech Naturalism

**Core Principles:**
1. Earthy warmth meets clean technology - bridging traditional tea culture with modern marketing tools
2. Natural textures and organic shapes balanced with crisp UI elements
3. Warm, inviting color palette that feels approachable yet professional

**Signature Elements:**
1. Organic wave dividers between sections
2. Soft watercolor-style background textures
3. Circular imagery with decorative borders

**Interaction Philosophy:** Warm, welcoming interactions. Buttons have satisfying hover states with color shifts. Cards lift gently on hover. Everything feels tactile and inviting.
