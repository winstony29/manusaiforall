# Challenge 1: AI-Powered Bubble Tea Sommelier

**Problem Statement**

With 11+ drink options and countless customization possibilities (sugar levels, ice levels, toppings), customers often feel overwhelmed when ordering. How might we use AI to help customers discover their perfect bubble tea match while encouraging them to explore new flavors?

**Background**

Tea Dojo offers a diverse menu ranging from classic milk teas to specialty coffee drinks and traditional Asian beverages. Each drink can be customized with different sugar levels, ice levels, and toppings. First-time customers often struggle to choose, while repeat customers may fall into ordering habits that prevent them from discovering other menu items they might enjoy.

**Expected Outcomes**

Participants should develop an AI-powered recommendation system that could take the form of a chatbot, mobile app, or interactive kiosk interface. The solution should consider factors such as customer preferences, past orders, weather conditions, time of day, and trending items. Bonus features could include flavor profile explanations, pairing suggestions, and the ability for customers to create and name custom drinks.

**Success Metrics**

The solution should demonstrate increased customer engagement, reduced ordering time, and potential for increased average order value through smart upselling of toppings and add-ons.
