# Challenge 6: Dynamic Pricing and Promotion Optimization

**Problem Statement**

Demand for bubble tea varies throughout the day and week, with peak hours creating long queues while off-peak hours see low traffic. How might we use AI to implement dynamic pricing or targeted promotions that balance demand and maximize revenue?

**Background**

Like many F&B businesses, Tea Dojo experiences significant demand fluctuations. Lunch hours and after-school periods are busy, while mid-afternoon and late evening see reduced traffic. Weather also impacts demand, with hot days driving higher sales. Currently, pricing remains static regardless of demand, missing opportunities to attract customers during slow periods or optimize revenue during peak times.

**Expected Outcomes**

Participants should develop an AI-powered pricing and promotion system that analyzes demand patterns and recommends dynamic pricing strategies or targeted promotions. The solution could include time-based happy hour suggestions, weather-triggered promotions, and loyalty rewards optimization. The system should balance revenue optimization with customer perception and fairness considerations.

**Success Metrics**

The solution should demonstrate increased revenue during off-peak hours, reduced wait times during peak hours, and improved overall revenue per operating hour.
