# Challenge 3: Event Booking and Planning AI Assistant

**Problem Statement**

Tea Dojo offers bubble tea live stations and push cart services for events, but managing inquiries, quotes, and bookings can be time-consuming for a small business. How might we use AI to streamline the event booking process while providing excellent customer service?

**Background**

Event catering is a growing revenue stream for Tea Dojo. Customers inquire about live stations and push carts for weddings, corporate events, birthday parties, and community gatherings. Each event requires custom quotes based on guest count, drink selection, duration, and location. Currently, this process is handled manually, which can lead to delayed responses and missed opportunities.

**Expected Outcomes**

Participants should develop an AI-powered booking assistant that can handle initial customer inquiries, provide instant quotes, suggest appropriate packages, and guide customers through the booking process. The solution should be able to check availability, calculate pricing, and collect necessary event details. Integration with calendar systems and payment processing would enhance the solution.

**Success Metrics**

The solution should demonstrate faster response times to inquiries, increased booking conversion rates, and reduced administrative workload for staff.
