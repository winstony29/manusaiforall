# Challenge 8: Sustainability Tracker and Eco-Friendly Operations Advisor

**Problem Statement**

Consumers increasingly care about sustainability, but bubble tea shops face challenges with single-use cups, straws, and packaging. How might we use AI to help Tea Dojo track, reduce, and communicate their environmental impact?

**Background**

The bubble tea industry has faced criticism for its environmental impact, particularly regarding single-use plastics. Tea Dojo wants to become more sustainable but lacks visibility into their environmental footprint and guidance on which changes would have the greatest impact. Customers are also interested in supporting eco-friendly businesses but need transparency about sustainability efforts.

**Expected Outcomes**

Participants should develop an AI-powered sustainability tracking and advisory system that monitors environmental metrics (waste generated, energy usage, water consumption), identifies opportunities for improvement, and helps communicate sustainability efforts to customers. Features could include a customer-facing sustainability dashboard, rewards for customers who bring reusable cups, and recommendations for eco-friendly suppliers and practices.

**Success Metrics**

The solution should demonstrate measurable reductions in waste and resource consumption, increased customer engagement with sustainability initiatives, and improved brand perception among environmentally conscious consumers.
