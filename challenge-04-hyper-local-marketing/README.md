# Challenge 4: Hyper-Local Marketing Intelligence Platform

**Problem Statement**

As a neighborhood bubble tea shop in Ang Mo Kio, Tea Dojo needs to connect with the local community effectively. How might we use AI to create personalized, hyper-local marketing campaigns that resonate with residents and drive foot traffic?

**Background**

Tea Dojo serves the Ang Mo Kio community, a residential area in Singapore. Marketing efforts need to be targeted and relevant to local residents, considering factors like nearby schools, offices, community events, and local preferences. With limited marketing budgets, small businesses need to maximize the impact of every marketing dollar spent.

**Expected Outcomes**

Participants should develop an AI-powered marketing platform that analyzes local trends, social media conversations, and customer data to generate targeted marketing content. The solution should be able to create and schedule social media posts, identify optimal posting times, suggest promotional offers, and track campaign performance. Features for generating localized content and identifying community partnership opportunities would be valuable additions.

**Success Metrics**

The solution should demonstrate increased social media engagement, improved customer acquisition costs, and measurable increases in foot traffic during promotional periods.
