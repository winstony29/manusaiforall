# Challenge 7: Multilingual AI Ordering Assistant

**Problem Statement**

Singapore is a multilingual society, and customers may prefer to order in different languages or dialects. How might we use AI to create an inclusive ordering experience that accommodates customers who speak English, Mandarin, Malay, or other languages?

**Background**

Ang Mo Kio has a diverse population including elderly residents who may be more comfortable ordering in Mandarin or other languages. Staff may not always be fluent in all languages spoken by customers, which can lead to miscommunication and a less welcoming experience for some community members.

**Expected Outcomes**

Participants should develop a multilingual AI ordering assistant that can understand and respond in multiple languages commonly spoken in Singapore. The solution could take the form of a voice-activated kiosk, mobile app, or tablet-based ordering system. It should handle the full ordering process including customizations and payment, with seamless language switching capabilities.

**Success Metrics**

The solution should demonstrate improved accessibility for non-English speaking customers, reduced ordering errors, and positive feedback from diverse customer segments.
