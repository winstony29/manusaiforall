# Challenge 5: AI-Powered Customer Feedback and Sentiment Analysis

**Problem Statement**

Customer feedback is scattered across multiple platforms (Google Reviews, social media, in-store comments), making it difficult to identify trends and areas for improvement. How might we use AI to aggregate, analyze, and act on customer feedback in real-time?

**Background**

Tea Dojo receives feedback through various channels including Google reviews, Facebook comments, Instagram mentions, and verbal feedback in-store. This fragmented feedback makes it challenging to identify recurring issues, track customer satisfaction trends, and respond promptly to concerns. Small businesses often lack the resources to monitor all these channels effectively.

**Expected Outcomes**

Participants should develop an AI-powered feedback aggregation and analysis system that collects reviews and mentions from multiple platforms, performs sentiment analysis, identifies common themes and issues, and generates actionable insights. The solution should provide real-time alerts for negative feedback requiring immediate attention and suggest appropriate responses. A dashboard for tracking customer satisfaction trends over time would be essential.

**Success Metrics**

The solution should demonstrate improved response times to customer feedback, identification of actionable improvement areas, and measurable improvements in customer satisfaction scores.
